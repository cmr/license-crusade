Relicense to dual MIT/Apache-2.0

This pull request was automatically generated because my scripts detected that
everyone in the [relicensing issue]({{relicense_issue}}) agreed to
relicensing.

License headers in files were not updated, if they exist. I've reproduced an
example license header below if you want to copy-paste it in. If you don't
have license headers, [don't feel compelled to add
them](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21481#issuecomment-71029250).

I recommend publishing a new patch version (the `z` in `x.y.z`) so that the
metadata propagates to `crates.io`.

Please be sure to check the `README.md` for style. I've try to
review these PRs as they go out, but I might miss something.

Thanks for relicensing!
